      "text": "Labor is offering households up to $2,200 to purchase solar panels, eventually taking the total number of NSW homes with rooftop solar past the one-million mark. Eligible homes must be owner-occupied and the scheme is restricted to families on a combined income of no more than $180,000 per year. The move will help ease the pressure on New South Wales’ ageing and unreliable coal-fired generators, while also lowering pollution and power prices. Opposition Leader Michael Daley said the scheme would save families up to $1000 a year. The Liberals responded the following next day, announcing a policy to offer interest-free loans to families to install rooftop solar and battery storage systems. The Liberal plan will cover 300,000 homes, and also be capped at a combined household income of $180,000. While Labor’s policy is a strong start, offering grants rather than loans to a greater number of households, there is still room for improvement, such as the need to include renters in their plans. Meanwhile Gladys Berejiklian’s Liberals need to do more. Coming on the back of 8 years of climate inaction from the NSW Liberals, this policy is too little, too late. There are already commercial operators offering low or no-interest loans for solar installation, so it’s debatable that this policy adds much value without a suite of other targeted measures. At the same time, it’s certainly a step in the right direction that all the parties are at least recognising the need to increase solar uptake, even if ambition levels are variable. Unsurprisingly, the Greens have an even more ambitious policy than both their major rivals, yesterday revealing a bold plan to make solar and battery storage mandatory at all new homes in New South Wales. The scheme would also see all NSW government buildings powered by 100 percent renewable energy. All proposals will help reduce the pressure on New South Wales’ ageing and unreliable coal fleet and help families deal with high power prices. However, none of the policies do enough to offer clean energy solutions to people unable to access solar, like apartment dwellers. People who rent deserve to be able to access clean and cheap energy too. That’s why Greenpeace is calling on the next New South Wales government to introduce a solar rebate to help families that are renting, to access solar panels – or help those who already have solar to install battery storage.",

My name is Oscar Alateras. I am a 16-year-old high school student currently attending Aquinas College in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. My dream is to become an environmental engineer where I will not only investigate environmental solutions, but put them into place as well. This is at least 7 or 8 years away, maybe even more, and current circumstances have made it quite obvious to me that I can not afford to wait until then to make a difference in the global battle against climate change. I must start now. This is exactly what I have done. I have been a climate activist for roughly three years now. Many may ask, why climate change? Why is it this particular issue that I have chosen to act against? The answer to this question may vary from person to person, but for me, the answer is simple: passion. Now this passion didn’t just appear out of mid-air. There were specific events that allowed me to discover it. I was in Year 7, and my class was shown the environmental documentary ‘Before The Flood’ by Leonardo Di Caprio. After seeing this, it made me realise that if a man as busy as Di Caprio took the time to film a documentary aimed to raise awareness for climate change, then it must be an important issue. Subsequent to this, I started to spend hours researching about climate change, as prior to the documentary, I had no idea that climate change was even a thing. It didn’t take me long to realise the full picture of what was going on: to realise that were in a global existential crisis. If I am being completely honest, all the alarming statistics and data put fear right into my heart, as I was afraid for the security of my future. I knew it was in danger, and that unfortunately, past generations, the main contributors of climate change, were not willing to make up for their mistakes and save my future. Instead, they were too proud, too selfish to admit they were wrong and chose to ignore the issue even though deep down in their conscience they knew they were putting billions of futures such as mine on the line. This feeling of pure fear coupled with the fact that I didn’t want others to suffer from this crisis motivated me to take action: it motivated me to take my future into my own hands and encourage other young people to do the same.",

      "text": "Australia’s beautiful Great Barrier Reef is under threat and in a state of emergency. As much as half of the Reef may be dead following back to back coral bleaching events in recent years. The Great Barrier Reef is a living thing – precious and fragile. It’s is the only living thing on earth that is visible from space. Climate change and the fossil fuel industry have been constant threats to the Great Barrier Reef and it needs protecting now more than ever. The coal industry is accelerating global warming by mining and burning coal, and is putting the future of the Reef at risk. In 2016, warming oceans caused the worst coral bleaching event in history on the Great Barrier Reef and almost a quarter of the Reef’s coral died. Scientists tell us we can have either coral or coal, but not both. Yet, the Australian government continues to promote the expansion of the coal industry. Australia’s carbon emissions are rising, and the Australian government approved the world’s biggest coal mine on the doorstep of the Great Barrier Reef. Tiny algae live in the tissue of coral providing it with food, and also giving coral its colour. As the ocean absorbs more and more CO2 from the atmosphere, ocean temperatures and acidity levels in the water rise. The algae become stressed and leave the coral – taking with it the coral’s source of food and its colour. The coral turns white and ‘bleaches’. The Reef is under continued threat from climate change and industrialisation by the fossil fuel industry. But it’s not too late – the Reef can recover in the right conditions and with time. But an expansion of the coal industry will accelerate dangerous climate change and cripple any chance the Reef has of repairing itself.

We had an overwhelming amount of responses. Here are a few that we loved to hate the most! Days of Action: “Stickering” events allowed us to show Coles and Woolies which fruits and vegetables we want to see plastic-free in the future. No way our earth is going to live apple-y ever after once all this packaging seeps into our oceans! This packaging shucks. What happened to the husk, or as we like to call it, natural packaging? A root awakening – Coles and Woolies are convinced potatoes can’t survive without all this packaging, but we’d be thrilled to prove them wrong. Getting Coles and Woolies to remove excessive packaging from their stores has been an incredibly cucumbersome process – and we need your help. Lettuce take a moment to realise how utterly shameful all this packaging is! Help us tell Coles and Woolies that this needs to end. I’m no expert, but don’t the bananas on the left look far more a-peeling than those on the right? Coles and Woolies have announced that they will test out cutting back on plastic for produce items. But we’re not so convinced: both stores have temporarily gone back on the recent plastic bag ban that took effect earlier this month. If these stores can’t ban the bag, how will they be able to manage ousting ridiculous packaging in produce? As consumers, we can harness the power of collective action to tell Coles and Woolies what their buyers want. Do you want plastic free produce and a better future for our lands and oceans? Join the movement today and sign our petition against plastic packaging: the t hyme is now!",

Tuna is a family of fish that come in many different species, some from populations that are doing better than others. It is therefore critical to ensure that the species of tuna that you buy is one that is not in harvested at a rate that is threatening the population. Make sure that the tuna product clearly identifiesthe species name, otherwise don’t buy it. If it’s labelled as “thunnus” or “genus thunnus” it simply means it is in the tuna family, not which type of species has been caught. Bluefin is typically the most expensive tuna and classified as an endangered species. Mostly found in high-end restaurants as sashimi or sushi, Bluefin has three species; Atlantic, Pacific and Southern. Bluefin has been extremely overfished, and Southern Bluefin, the only type caught and sold in Australia, is already classified as critically endangered. > AVOID BLUEFIN TUNA Bigeye tuna often consumed as tuna steaks, sushi or sashimi and is one of the most expensive types of tuna, often found in restaurants. The bigeye tuna population is low with overfishing occurring in the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. > AVOID BIGEYE TUNA Yellowfin mostly served as sashimi, sushi, tuna steak or canned. Yellowfin is also vulnerable to population decline through increased bycatch caused by fishing vessels using FADs, fishing levels for yellowfin tuna in Australia are probably OK, but in the Pacific and Indian Oceans they are under more pressure. > EAT LESS YELLOWFIN TUNA Albacore is often sold as “white tuna” in the supermarket and is mainly canned.

Turnbull’s government have been using the line that not-for-profits are just a front for foreign funds to be used to influence Australian election outcomes. Which is weird, because a review by the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Committee has found no evidence that charities receiving foreign funds are influencing Australian policy. What would the laws mean for me and for organisations like Greenpeace? In short: The Electoral Amendment bill would change the rules so that organisations like Greenpeace are classified as ‘political campaigners’. The Espionage and Foreign Interference bill would mean a person or organisation that receives or communicates “politically sensitive” information to the public could potentially be guilty of espionage under this Bill. This is a concern for everyone working to hold the government to account, because they can make “politically sensitive” mean whatever they want it to. The Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme bill would crack down on not-for-profits that have a global presence – like Greenpeace. We’d be required to spend more time on reporting and paperwork, which means less time campaigning for healthy oceans, a thriving Great Barrier Reef and action on climate change. You can read more about the democracy attack laws here. What’s this about the report that came out on Monday? While the FITS and EFI bills are stuck in another committee process, The Joint Standing Committee into Electoral Matters released its report on the Electoral Amendment bill. The report was authored by the Coalition and the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and was bipartisan (that means they both agreed), with 15 recommended changed to the law, but—here’s the kicker—they didn’t reject the law outright. Even if the government agreed to all the Committee’s recommendations, the new law would still stifle the important work charities do to make Australia a caring and compassionate nation and hold powerful corporations to account. The Greens were the only members of the Committee to publish a report that entirely rejected the bill. Wait, aren’t Labor supposed to be on our side? You’d think so, and they say they are. In fact, Shadow Minister for Charities and NFP Andrew Leigh told us at the Hands Off Our Charities democracy sausage sizzle that he ‘had our backs’. But Monday’s report says the contrary: that Labor seems willing to throw charities under the bus so it can pass the Electoral Amendment bill. Gross. So we need to get Labor to stop the bill? We’re challenging Labor to stay true to their word of being allies to not-for-profits. Labor must reject all of these laws, starting with the Electoral Amendment bill. It’s disappointing to watch a party that has for so long stood up for workers’ rights and for the least privileged in our society, now turning against unions, charities and not-for-profits. Sounds like we need to stop these laws. We agree. And we’ve been fighting these bills every step of the way.",

It was opened in 1971 and is due to shut down by the end of 2022.|| The National Energy Guarantee. It’s the Turnbull government’s signature energy policy. It’s been called: ‘pathetic’ ‘too weak’ ‘a line in the sand moment’ Most of those criticisms have rightly been about its disastrously low emissions reduction target of 26% from 2005 levels by 2030. Economic modelling from a range of sources, including work by RepuTex commissioned by Greenpeace, shows that the NEG’s 26% target will be met in the early 2020s on current policies : that is, regardless of whether the NEG is implemented at all. And a 26% target is far too low for what is needed to take on global warming and help prevent the extreme weather we’re seeing around the globe. Even ACIL Allen, the consulting firm on whose analysis the government is basing its whole policy, have published a briefing note on their website strongly criticising the government’s approach to energy policy and the NEG. But it turns out that it’s not just the target that’s bad. The NEG mechanism itself – the nuts and bolts design of how the system is meant to work – is also a disaster. Last week, the director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Professor Bruce Mountain, published a 15 page analysis of the NEG mechanism as outlined by the Energy Security Board (ESB). Here’s a summary of what he found ( spoiler : it’s not good). The ESB’s modelling of a business as usual scenario is flawed and based on false assumptions. It assumes that: None of these assumptions are valid. A policy based on them will fail from the start. The design of the Emissions Guarantee component is much more complicated than comparable schemes The design of the Reliability Guarantee component is also very complex, and hard to implement There is no defined penalty for electricity retailers if they repeatedly fail to meet their emissions intensity obligations There are various perverse incentives and unintended consequences in the NEG design, including Only retailers and generators will have access to the NEG registry The fiendishly complicated nature of the NEG’s design means that it takes some effort to get to grips with it. But when you do, it’s crystal clear that it’s not just the emissions target that is a problem. The NEG mechanism is so flawed as to be close to useless. The NEG is like a sports car that is speed limited to 50 kmh, but whose engine is so badly made anyway that you can’t be sure it will even start. Australians deserve better than Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg’s lemon.",

Aside from these worrying concerns the entire process also highlights the lack of transparency when it comes to oil and gas exploration and the potential impact on communities and marine ecosystems. The documents describe a spill that would potentially be so bad that scenarios are outlined where more than twice the amount of crude oil that entered the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster would be spilled.

      "text": "In just over a month Victoria goes to the polls. What’s at stake, I hear you ask. Nothing more than the future of the renewable energy revolution. As it stands Victoria is among the states leading the way in the transition from dirty fossil fuels to clean and reliable renewable energy. Victoria has the nation’s only state legislated renewable energy target, the VRET, and Premier Daniel Andrews recently announced an ambitious plan to help 650,000 homes install rooftop solar . While far from perfect, the current trajectory for clean energy in Victoria looks bright. Renewables already provide 12 percent of the state’s energy, and that is set to increase rapidly to 40 percent by 2025 under the VRET. It’s still well short of the 100 percent by 2030 that Greenpeace is calling for Australia-wide, but it’s also more ambitious than many other states at this point in time. There’s so much at risk in this election because the renewable projects Victoria needs are being rolled out as we speak. Just last month the state held a series of reverse auctions that will generate more than 900MW of power . Solar farms at Cohuna, Carwarp and Winton will be developed as part of the scheme, along with wind farms at Mortlake South, Berrybank and Dundonnel. The projects will create 900 jobs and produce enough electricity to power more than 645,000 homes, Mr Andrews said last month. But despite Victoria’s commitment to renewables being enshrined in law, the state actually reaching its target is no fait accompli. Worryingly for the environment, business and thousands of Victorian families, Opposition Leader Matthew Guy has pledged to dump the VRET should the Coalition prevail next month. With a slew of projects in the pipeline, any move to cut the VRET would not only jeopardise Australia’s chances of meeting its emissions targets under the Paris Agreement, but it would also precipitate widespread job losses. The implications for the planet would be disastrous, but seemingly not content with just slamming the brakes on the renewable revolution, Matthew Guy also appears to be proud to lead a party with no policy to address climate change. Activists went looking for it last month but have so far failed to turn up any evidence that Victoria’s aspiring government believes in climate change, or has a plan to do anything about it. Perhaps those activists should turn their investigative nous to the federal government, which also has no plan to address global warming. You would think that the Victorian Coalition would heed the not-too subtle message of the Wentworth by-election – It’s the climate, stupid! But if it sticks to its non-plans and destructive commitments vis-a-vis the VRET, it will repeat the Coalition’s folly and crab walk to electoral defeat. Australians want renewable energy and Victorian even more so. Polling Greenpeace commissioned during the heated debate over the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) found that 77 percent of Victorians want Australia to embrace a high renewable energy target to help put downward pressure on power prices. The poll also found that more than 76 percent of Victorians believe the best way for the government to ensure low cost reliable electricity supply is to invest in renewables, along with dispatchable storage solutions like batteries and 74.5 percent of Victorian, want renewables to receive more government support than fossil fuels such as coal. Voters made their minds up about renewables a long time ago.",

      "text": "It’s time for rich and high polluting countries to step up their efforts and take real action on climate change as world leaders head to the United Nations climate change conference – COP24 – in Katowice in a few days’ time. The urgent need for world leaders to commit to a plan that will save us from the catastrophic impacts of global warming was demonstrated last week, by nations on the frontlines of climate change. The Marshall Islands hosted a world-first, “Virtual Climate Summit”, as chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF). The online summit was complemented by offline activities, celebrating the Marshallese culture and resilience to climate change, as well as, solidarity actions held in Fiji and Vanuatu by the Pacific Island Represent network. The message from this inaugural event was that for the vulnerable countries to survive and thrive, the world needs to act with urgency and rapidly transition away for fossil fuels to have a genuine chance of stopping global temperature rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius. The summit signalled that the countries most impacted by climate change have taken it upon themselves to inspire the leadership needed from those who continue to profit from the destruction of the planet. At the end of the online summit, CVF members adopted the Jummemj declaration, which draws its name from a Marshallese word of seafaring origin signifying a call to action of vigilance, keeping watch against threats. “We urge COP24 to act on the findings of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C, as informed by the Talanoa Dialogue, sending a strong signal for all nations, and non-state actors, to contribute to the generation of new ambition, for the enhancement of all nationally determined contributions to the global response to climate change (NDCs) by 2020,” the declaration reads. But the declaration goes further than just calling on bigger nations step up their climate action. It outlines plans by the CVF members themselves to raise their own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2020 at the latest, as well as a call for urgent action to increase flows of international climate finance and to all nations, state governments and businesses, to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. During the UN Climate Week in September, the Marshall Islands president, Dr Hilda Heine, announced her country’s plans to become carbon neutral by 2050, making the island nation the first to do so. The Fijian prime minister had also announced at the same meeting that his country will announce their long-term strategy to go carbon neutral at the Conference of Parties (COP24) in Poland. Vanuatu has become the first nation state to announce its plans to pursue legal action against the corporations and countries that benefit from the planet’s destruction. The Melanesian island nation is home to some 260,000 people but their moral compass is far greater than big polluters like the U.S, Germany and even their coal-loving neighbour Australia. Vanuatu’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Ralph Regenvanu, has put the fossil fuel industry and the states that give it life on notice. “ My government is now exploring all avenues to utilise the judicial system in various jurisdictions – including under international law – to shift the costs of climate protection back onto the fossil fuel companies, the financial institutions and the governments that actively and knowingly created this existential threat to Vanuatu,” Ragenvanu announced at the CVF Summit. Vanuatu’s pursuits will only inspire other vulnerable nations to hold those who are responsible for climate change. For the Pacific and other vulnerable countries, the climate fight is about hope – for their people, their cultures, their land and everything that they identify with and what makes them unique. It’s not too late if the rich nations show the same commitment that the developing nations have shown to address an issue that they are responsible for.",

      "text": "The dust has settled from the G8 meeting in Italy where politicians gathered to discuss the greatest challenge facing our civilisation. I was going to write ‘world leaders’ but ‘politicians’ is a more accurate term. Leadership implies vision and decisive action. All we got from the G8 was hot air. We have 145 days to go until the Copenhagen meeting when Governments of the world will meet to thrash out the final detail of a global treaty to cut emissions. The stakes are high. Climate change is a global emergency and it requires a global response. The Kyoto Protocol largely failed to cut emissions or create the transition to a low carbon economy. Copenhagen will replace Kyoto and might be the last chance to get a global treaty in time to make a difference. The G8 meeting, and the Major Economies Forum that followed, was a crucial milestone on the road to Copenhagen. And the news isn’t good. The G8 and the MEF waffled their way through various statements that avoided putting any hard numbers on the table and tried to dress up old news as progress. As usual, rich (developed) countries are trying to blame less developed countries for the lack of progress. Everyone keeps on saying it is up to India and China to take action and put targets on the table. China is already starting to take steps to cut emissions but the reality is that the failure of leadership lies with the developed world who are largely responsible for causing climate change and who have the resources to drive the transformation. Despite mountains of spin, Kevin Rudd and the Australian Government are still undermining progress towards a strong treaty at Copenhagen. By putting forward a pathetically low emissions reduction target (only 5-25% cuts by 2020), Australia is sending all of the wrong signals. But perhaps more insidious is the work of our negotiating team to push for offset loopholes that would mean that even our paltry emissions target can be offset either by changing land-use practices or paying other countries to protect forests. Meanwhile, our coal industry and industrial pollution continues to grow. Kevin Rudd needs to commit to halve greenhouse pollution within the next decade, as well as putting substantial money on the table to help drive the transition to a low carbon economy in developing countries.",

      "text": "You will not find any reference to them in review articles, books or IPCC reports. I set out to investigate this relationship using solar activity data and the Oceanic El Niño Index, which shows in blue the periods when the equatorial Pacific is cooler than average and in red when it is warmer. Since solar cycles have slightly different lengths, I divided both data series into segments of a solar cycle and then adjusted the length to be the same for all cycles. This statistical technique is called epoch analysis. In this way, the mean and variance of the data are determined for periods that coincide in their phase of the cycle. This revealed a pattern that indicates an El Niño response to solar activity. I looked at a period when the cycle is gaining activity, which is accompanied by La Niña conditions. I used the Monte Carlo method to determine the probability that this result was random, and the answer was only 0. This means that there is a 99. 3% chance that the La Niña conditions at this time in the solar cycle are due to the Sun. X-axis is the variable length of a full solar cycle. Right curves show the mean and standard deviation of left curves. Red rectangle indicates the part of the data analyzed by Monte Carlo method. Since the answer is clearer for La Niña, I analyzed the relative frequencies of each phase of the El Niño phenomenon. What is observed is that the Neutral condition years follow the solar cycle in their frequency with a delay of one or two years. Surprisingly, the frequency of La Niña is the opposite of Neutral. The solar activity determines whether it is a La Niña year or a Neutral year. El Niño seems to have another cause, which could be the amount of heat accumulated in the ocean. classification shown in the bottom squares. Frequency was calculated for a sliding window and Gaussian smoothed. It is striking that with so much evidence and studies, the vast majority of scientists do not know that the Sun controls the very important El Niño phenomenon. But El Niño is a product of the action of the trade winds over the equatorial Pacific. To control El Niño, the Sun must control the atmospheric circulation.",

If this energy increases by 0. 1%, then every point on the surface receives 0. One would expect this to cause a small overall warming, estimated by scientists to be two hundredths of a degree Celsius, which is undetectable. But that is not what is being observed. Several studies show that over the solar cycle, the surface is warming times more than expected, C, and it is doing so in an extremely irregular way with large spatial variations. On the right are zonally averaged changes. Going from a solar minimum to a solar maximum, some areas show more than 1°C of warming, while others show more than half a degree of cooling. This is not the effect you would expect. If we analyze the average for each latitude, we observe a very strong warming around N latitude. But if we analyze the change at altitude, in the stratosphere, we observe something very curious. The response in this layer of the atmosphere is inverse to the response at the surface. Why is this important? The IPCC tells us that one of the fingerprints of warming due to our emissions is that we see warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. But if the Sun also shows an inverse response between the two, then the observation is no longer evidence of guilt from emissions. Years ago, some scientists studied the rates of warming and cooling in the upper layer of the tropical oceans. They found that it follows a cycle similar to that of the Sun. Instead of thinking that this supported an indirect effect of the Sun on climate, most scientists ignored the study.

S & J: Making the video was like a deep meditation on the subject of plastic pollution, and we learned some things ourselves as well.

We also became much more aware of how waste and plastics are disposed of and how little we actually recycle. With this newly learned knowledge we now try to bring awareness to people around us and encourage them to become involved too, in solving this massive problem. Greenpeace: How can people help with the issue of plastic waste in the oceans? NA: It’s the governments and big corporations that have made it hard for us to live without single-use plastics, such as food packaging, but we are all responsible. I think it’s more important to try to avoid using single-use plastics than assume that they’ll get recycled once thrown away. We’ve passed the point of being able to do much about most of the plastic already present in the ocean. The best thing that people can do is just to try to not make the problem worse.

      "text": "Steyn vs Mann Mark Steyn continues his free speech crusade in an article Yes we can say that. Towards the end of the article, Michael Mann and the climate debate gets a mention: Which brings us to Michael Mann, the fake Nobel laureate currently suing NATIONAL REVIEW for mocking his global-warming “hockey stick. ” Of the recent congressional hearings, Dr. Mann tweeted that it was “#Science” — i. the guy who agrees with him — vs. “#AntiScience” — i. Judith Curry, chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. That’s to say, she is by profession a scientist, but because she has the impertinence to dissent from Dr. Mann’s view she is “#AntiScience. ” Mann is the climatological equivalent of those bozo imams on al-Arabiya raging about infidel whores: He can’t refute Dr. Curry, he can only label her. He explains his aversion to appearing with anyone other than fawning groupies thus: “Getting on a debate stage signals that, while you might disagree, you respect the position of your opponent. ” But the reality is that he’s too insecure and dull-witted to argue. That’s why he’s suing me over a pun (“tree-ring circus”), why he threatened legal action in Minnesota over a song parody, and why he’s in court in Vancouver objecting to a bit of wordplay. “You can’t say that! ” is the refrain of those who can’t hold their own. Michael Mann is seeking massive damages from me and this magazine. Nuts to that. But I would be willing to buy him a course in debating technique — because in free societies that’s how you win. I’d also like to buy the wee thin-skinned chap a sense of humor, but I don’t think there’s a course for that. That’s a good example of why he’s careful never to expose himself to genuine debate, and why his cross-examination on the witness stand will be such a hoot. I suspect that this is not going to turn out well for you. I’m not predicting how Mann’s lawsuit will turn out, but Steyn’s relentless hammering of Mann seems to be doing far more damage to Mann’s reputation that the alleged legal defamation.",

As is the case with other religions, the best is repentance, humility and self-restriction – preferably through emission payments without end. ” Stephan writes that the new climate religion fills a void left behind by other religions, and tells us to feel guilty about prosperity. Eventually, we fear, we’ll have to pay the price for our prosperity – be it to God or Nature, – with Biblical plagues such as storms, huge tidal waves, floods, fire-spewing volcanoes, in short: death and demons”. Stephan warns us not to doubt the elite prophets who have the powers, tools and instruments to see deep into the future: The new priests who proclaim these scenarios have attracted billions of followers with their announcements of world downfall. And, like all other prophets, they do not tolerate any doubts about their predictions. Those who dare express doubt are nothing more than egotistical wretches, appeasers and trivializers, block-headed deniers or worse, or to the least paid agents of evil. ” As the climate zealotry and hysteria spread though society, it’s only logical that the obstacles that prevent necessary action, like democracy, be removed and replaced globally by an “authoritarian regime of experts”. The “projected global downfall is the state-of-emergency that justifies every measure and it distracts us from every other unfinished business.",

The key IPCC consensus finding from its latest assessment report is this statement: “Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. ” The IPCC consensus findings on attribution have been echoed in position statements made by many scientific organizations. The IPCC consensus is portrayed as nearly total among scientists with expertise and prominence in the field of climate science. The idea of a scientific consensus surrounding climate change attribution has been questioned by a number of people, including scientists and politicians. Much effort has been undertaken by those that support the IPCC consensus to discredit skeptical voices, essentially dismissing them as cranks or at best rebels, or even politically motivated ‘deniers’. Students of science are taught to reject ad populam or ‘bandwagon’ appeals, a sentiment is articulated by the motto of the UK Royal Society: ‘nullius in verba’, which is roughly translated as ‘take nobody’s word for it’. How then, and why, have climate scientists come to a scientific consensus about a very complex scientific problem that the consensus-supporting scientists themselves acknowledge has substantial and fundamental uncertainties? Consensus and dissent The debate surrounding the consensus on climate change is complicated by the complexity of both the scientific and the associated sociopolitical issues. Under the consensual approach, the goal of science is a consensus of rational opinion over the widest possible field. The opposing view of science is that of dissension, whereby scientific progress occurs via subversion of consensus in favor of new experiments, ideas and theories. When is it reasonable for a person to conform to a consensus and when is it reasonable to dissent? With genuinely well-established scientific theories, ‘consensus’ is not discussed and the concept of consensus is arguably irrelevant. For example, there is no point to discussing a consensus that the Earth orbits the sun, or that the hydrogen molecule has less mass than the nitrogen molecule.
